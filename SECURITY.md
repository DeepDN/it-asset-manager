## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

#### Deployment Security

```bash
# 1. Use strong admin passwords
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# 2. Enable HTTPS in production
# Configure SSL certificates
cp your-cert.pem docker/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
cp your-key.pem docker/nginx/ssl/key.pem

# 3. Secure environment variables
chmod 600 .env
chown root:root .env

# 4. Regular backups with encryption
tar czf - instance/ | gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 \
  --symmetric --output backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz.gpg
```

#### Network Security

```bash
# Firewall configuration (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
sudo ufw --force enable

# Docker security
# Run containers with limited privileges
docker run --user 1000:1000 --read-only --tmpfs /tmp
```

#### Database Security

```python
# Use environment variables for database credentials
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL', 
    'sqlite:///instance/it_assets.db')

# Enable database encryption (for production)
# Use encrypted database solutions like AWS RDS with encryption
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices

```python
# 1. Input validation
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, validators

class AssetForm(FlaskForm):
    serial_number = StringField('Serial Number', [
        validators.Length(min=4, max=25),
        validators.Regexp(r'^[A-Z0-9]+$', message="Invalid format")
    ])

# 2. SQL injection prevention
# Good - Using SQLAlchemy ORM
assets = Asset.query.filter(Asset.serial_number == user_input).all()

# Bad - String concatenation
# query = f"SELECT * FROM assets WHERE serial = '{user_input}'"

# 3. XSS prevention
from markupsafe import escape
safe_output = escape(user_input)

# 4. CSRF protection
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect
csrf = CSRFProtect(app)
```

#### Authentication & Authorization

```python
# Secure password handling
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

# Hash passwords
password_hash = generate_password_hash(password, method='pbkdf2:sha256')

# Verify passwords
is_valid = check_password_hash(password_hash, password)

# Session security
app.config.update(
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax',
    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=timedelta(hours=1)
)
```
